# Exercise
This file contains the solutions for the Exercise along with code explanations and graphs.

Exercise (No. 1,3,4,6) EDA and Machine Learning:

1-Identify Data Anomalies: identify any data anomalies and provide justification for how you would treat the issues you find in the dataset.

3-Government Spending Analysis: Through analysis, confirm how much has been spent in terms of value by government entities.

4-Data Integration and Demand Analysis: Describe how you would approach the integration of additional demand data into this dataset and what further analysis you could perform to better understand demand patterns.

6-Machine Learning Forecasting: Leverage Machine Learning (ML) to forecast and predict how much will be spent in terms of value by government entities

(Exercise No.2) Time Series Analysis: time series from the 2017 expense data and visualization to show the expense quantity trend.

(Exercise No.5) Graphical Representations and KPIs: Using the library and layout of your choice, provide 2-3 mockups of relevant graphical representations and adequate KPIs to visualize the country’s key financial elements, inspired by the Budget Statement for 2024 publicly available on the Ministry of Finance’s website. Solve exercise number 5, which involves selecting three tables(Global Economy Growth, Inflation, Sectoral Expenditure) from a file of the Budget Statement for 2024, processing them, and visualizing the data.
